## Overview

The Wikipedia Game involves navigating from one Wikipedia article to another using the fewest clicks possible. The current implementation employs a BFS algorithm to find the shortest path between articles. However, due to the vast and densely interconnected nature of Wikipedia, this method often leads to slow performance and inefficient pathfinding, as it does not account for the relevance or semantic relationship between articles.

The primary goal is to enhance the Wikipedia Game by introducing a more sophisticated pathfinding algorithm. This algorithm will aim for the shortest path in terms of clicks and also consider the semantic relevance between articles, making sure that the process is efficient and meaningful.

## Improvement

To address these issues, I propose integrating semantic analysis and graph databases into the game's pathfinding mechanism. By employing word embeddings, such as Word2Vec or BERT, we can calculate the semantic similarities between articles. This calculation allows for a more directed and relevant pathfinding strategy that focus on articles that are not just linked but contextually related.

Furthermore, using a graph database like Neo4j or ArangoDB will enable efficient storage and querying of the complex web of Wikipedia articles and their connections. This combination of semantic understanding and advanced data storage will drastically improve the game's performance making the pathfinding process both faster and more relevant.

## Pseudocode

    def find_path(start_article, end_article, embeddings, graph_database):
    # Initialize priority queue and set start_article as the starting point
    queue = [(0, start_article)]
    visited = set()

    while queue:
        _, current_article = queue.pop(0)  # Pop the article with the highest priority
        if current_article == end_article:
            return True  # Path found

        for neighbor in graph_database.get_neighbors(current_article):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                # Prioritize neighbors based on semantic similarity
                priority = semantic_similarity(embeddings[end_article], embeddings[neighbor])
                queue.append((priority, neighbor))
        
        queue.sort(reverse=True)  # Sort queue based on priority for the next iteration

    return False  # Path not found
